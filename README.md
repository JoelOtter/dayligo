# dayligo

Dayligo is a library for working with [Daylio](daylio.net) backup files in the
`.daylio` format. It contains a definition of the internal structure of this
file, utility functions for packing and unpacking these backups, and an example
script used to import Habit backups into Daylio.

I wrote a little bit about how it works on [my blog](
